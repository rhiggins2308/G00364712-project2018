# H.Dip. Data Analytics - Programming &amp; Scripting - Project 2018 repository
## Completed by Robert Higgins (G00364712)

## How to use the files contained as part of this repository
- Download and Install Anaconda for your platform
- Download and install Visual Studio Code for your platform
- Download the file irisSummary.py to a working directory on your machine
- irisSummary.py contains a list of references that were used to assist in building the script
- Download the file iris.csv to a subdirectory "data"
- Open VS Code and navigate to your working directory
- Run "python irisSummary.py" from the Terminal window
- You will now see summary statistics for the data set, output to the Terminal window
- You will also now have a file "irisSummary.txt" generated in your working directory, that will contain these summary statistics
- A sample of the file is also contained in this repository

## Generating Summary Plots
- Use the histPlot.py file to generate histograms of the various variables: instructions on how to amend the script to plot each column are contained within the script
- Use the boxPlot.py file to generate boxplots of the various variables: instructions on how to amend the script to plot each column are contained within the script
- Samples of the various plots are contained in the "plots" directory within this repository

## Fisher's *Iris* Data Set
The famous Irish data set was developed by Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher, a renowned British statistician and geneticist.
The data set itself contains multivariate data concerning the different variation sof Iris flowers, of three related species (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). The data set consists of 50 samples from each species.
The various data collected for each sample are:
- petal width
- petal length
- sepal width (sepal is defined as "The outer parts of the flower (often green and leaf-like) that enclose a developing bud.")
- sepal length
- class (being one of the three species of iris, collected and measured)

## Where has the file been used in research
- Machine learning
- Data mining

## Further Investigations
I would like to spend more time working with various python libraries to investigate further what correlations and patterns exist between the various measurements taken for each species in the data set
