# Fisher's *Iris* Data Set
The famous Irish data set was developed by Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher, a renowned British statistician and geneticist.
The data set itself contains multivariate data concerning the different variation sof Iris flowers, of three related species (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). The data set consists of 50 samples from each species.
The various data collected for each sample are:
- petal width
- petal length
- sepal width (sepal is defined as "The outer parts of the flower (often green and leaf-like) that enclose a developing bud.")
- sepal length
- class (being one of the three species of iris, collected and measured)
